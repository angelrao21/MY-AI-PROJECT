# MY-AI-PROJECT
🚦 Intelligent Traffic Light Optimization System (AI/ML)

An AI-driven smart traffic management system designed to dynamically optimize traffic signal timings using real-time vehicle detection, machine learning, and adaptive decision-making.
The system aims to reduce congestion, improve traffic flow, and minimize unnecessary waiting time at intersections.

🌍 Problem Statement

Traditional traffic signals operate on fixed-time cycles, ignoring real-time traffic density. This leads to:

Unnecessary congestion on high-density roads

Increased waiting time and fuel consumption

Poor handling of dynamic traffic conditions

This project addresses these limitations by introducing intelligent, data-driven signal control.
